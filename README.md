# CSC 4792: Data Mining and Warehousing  
## Group Project  

### **Classification of Government Gazette Entries by Type**


## **just added the initial project success criteria**

### Problem Statement:

**The Government publishes official notices; these notices span multiple domains , such as legislation, appointments, notices, tenders, and regulations.When published these documents are not placed in categories. Classifying them could be time-consuming when done manually . Our goal here is to create a system that classifies these documents according to the domain they belong to.the system model is aimed at correctly predicting the domain.**
